chat_server
===========

Basic terminal based chat server

I have a server running for demoing purposes.
You have to telnet into 54.186.32.247 (port 9399) to check it out.
Example: telnet 54.186.32.247 9399 

It currently supports use of nicknames and joining/leaving of rooms.
Type /help to see the options.

Upcoming features:
browser based client
private messages
user created rooms
Stay tuned...
